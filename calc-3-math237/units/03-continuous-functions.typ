= Continuous Function

*Continuous Function Definition*: Function $f(x, y)$ is continuous at $(a, b)$ if and only if $lim_((x, y) arrow.r (a, b)) f(x, y) = f(a, b)$

If $f$ is continuous for every point in $D subset RR^2$ then $f$ is continuous on $D$

3 hidden requirements:
1. Limit exists at point
2. Function is defined at point
3. Equality between the two
