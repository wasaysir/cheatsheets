= Graphs of Scalar Functions

*Image*: The transformed output of the input of a function. 
*Domain*: All sets of input for a function
*Range*: All sets of output for a function
*Codomain*: A larger set containing the range.
*Scalar Function*: Function taking $n$ variables, whose domain is $RR^n$ and range is subset of $RR$
*Level Curves*: Curves of function $f$ that equal $k$, where $k$ is a constant in the range of $f$. 

*Contour Map*: Family of level curves. (Called this because a level curve is when the value is a certain height in the graph of the function, so each new level curve defines a new height)

*Exceptional Level Curve*: When a level curve has only one point.

*Cross Section*: The intersection of the graph of a scalar function with a plane.

*Level Set*: Given scalar function $f(x), x \in RR^n, f(x) = k, k in R(f)$
