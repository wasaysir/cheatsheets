= Hierarchy of Biological Systems

- Atom  
- Molecule  
- Organelle  
- Cell  
- Tissue  
- Organ  
- Organ system  
- Organism  
- Population  
- Community  
- Ecosystem  
- Biome  
- Biosphere

== High (macro) Levels -- Ecology

\ Biosphere: All life on Earth  
\ Biome: Continental scale grouping of ecosystems.  
\ Ecosystem: Groups of organisms from all biological domains within a physical environment.  
\ Community: Interspecific groups of interacting populations.  
\ Population: Groups of organisms of the same species.  
\ Organism: The basic living system, a functional grouping of lower-level components.

== Middle Levels -- Organization of Your Body

\ Organ system: Functional groups of organs.  
\ Organ: Functional groups of tissues.  
\ Tissue: Functional groups of cells.  
\ Cell: Basic unit of all life and the grouping of organelles.  
\ Organelle: Functional groups of biomolecules, biochemical reactions, and interactions (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria).

== Micro Level (Biological Molecules)

- Lipids  
- Nucleic acids  
- Carbohydrates  
- Proteins

== Nucleobases and the Genetic Code

- Nucleobases (abbr.: bases) are the minimal units of genetic code.  
- DNA/RNA comprises four types of bases.  
- Matching bases form base pairs: A - T/U; G - C.

== Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

\ DNA (Genome): Great book with instructions.  
\ RNA: Bona-fide transcript of relevant parts.  
\ Protein: Functional products.

== DNA: Structure and Genome

- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) carries genetic information.  
- The entire set of DNA of a cell is a genome.  
- The human genome consists of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).  
- DNA resides in the nucleus in the form of chromosomes.

== DNA Processes

- DNA is replicated during cell division by DNA polymerase (an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of DNA molecules).  
- DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by RNA polymerase.  
- mRNAs are translated into proteins in ribosomes (mini machines floating in the cytoplasm).  
- The translation regulation machinery goes beyond the primary structure.  
- Three nucleobases (called a codon) code one amino acid.
