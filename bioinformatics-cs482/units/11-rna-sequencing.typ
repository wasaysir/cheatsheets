= RNA Sequencing

\ Microarray Technology: Given mRNA do reverse transcription to find complimentary DNA, then place DNA on wafer and let it hybridize. Then we can measure the gene counts by the amount of fluorescent staining. Note we need ot know our target genes in advance.

\ RNA-Seq Technology: Given mRNA do reverse transcription to find complimentary DNA, then sequence the DNA read. If we have more reads, then we know that there are more of the RNA transcribed.
