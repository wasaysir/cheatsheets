= Neurons

== Biology
Neuron contains *Soma, Axon, Dendrites*. Signals travel away from Soma via Axon.

=== Membrane
Membranes contain Sodium and Potassium Channels and a Sodium-Potassium Pump.
Each Channel:
1. Na: Outside of cell
2. K: Inside of cell
3. Na-K Pump: 3 Sodium out for 2 Potassium in

*Voltage Difference (Membrane Potential)*: Difference in voltage on either side of membrane. Resting potential is -70mV. This resting potential is enforced by the Na-K Pump.

*Action Potential*: Electrical impulse travelling along axon to the synapse.
