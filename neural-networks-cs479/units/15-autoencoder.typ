= Autoencoders
\ Autoencoder: Neural network that learns to encode/decode a set of inputs automatically.

\ Latent Representation: Encoding for inputs derived from autoencoder.

Autoencoders use the same encoding matrix, transposed to decode. These weights are *tied weights*.

The embedding space is lower-dimensioned than the input space, to more efficiently encode the data.
