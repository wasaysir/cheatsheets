= Neural Learning
/ Supervised Learning: Desired output is known, and we can minimize error within our model's predictions
/ Regression: Output is continuous-based function of inputs, goal is to get closest to output function.
/ Classification: Outputs in discrete categories. 
/ Unsupervised Learning: Output not given, so find efficient structure of input
/ Reinforcement Learning: Feedback given, but uninformative, and depends on lots of variables (ex. Chess AI)
/ Optimization: Given neural model, optimize weights to minimize loss. $min_theta EE_((x, t) in "data") [cal(L)(f(x; theta), t(x))]$
