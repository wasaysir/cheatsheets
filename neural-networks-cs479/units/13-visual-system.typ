= Visual System

== Layers
Visual inputs from retina go through different layers.
1. Retina
2. LGN
3. V1
4. V2
5. V4
6. Inferior Temporal Lobe (Creates semantic meaning)

== Topological
Nearby neurons in primary visual cortex are nearby in the visual cortex (so there's a mapping between photoreceptors and neurons on the map of the brain)

Mapping is not uniform, denser photoreceptor region in center of fovea, and sparser near the peripheral. 

Each neuron is only activated by a small region in visual field, and converse is also true (patch of visual field only excites small neighbourhood of neurons in V1)

\ Retinotopic Mapping: Topological mapping between visual field and surface of the cortex.

The footprint of a region in visual field gets larger as data propagates up layers.

Mammalian visual systems break a visual scene into a set of edges. Each layer in the visual system then abstracts to even more edges, sometimes cures, until finally at the last layer it provides an abstract embeedding of concepts.
