= Visual System
Visual inputs from retina go through different layers.

Nearby neurons in one layer are nearby in other layer. Spatial relationship. Each neuron is activated by small region in visual field, and converse is also true.

Mammalian visual systems break a visual scene into a set of edges, then. Each layer in the visual system then abstracts to even more edges, sometimes curves, until finally at the last layer it provides an abstract embeedding of concepts.
